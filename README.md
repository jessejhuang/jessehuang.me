## About
I wanted to take a project to production, with a focus on scalabilty.
Throughout the design process, I kept ideas from this [article](https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1) about structuring React apps in mind. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
