      Hi there!
      My name is Jesse Huang and I am a senior at Washington University in St Louis.
      Among other things, I am a programmer, a resident advisor, and an occasional poet.
      I spent this past summer in Beijing working as a front end development intern for
      <a href="http://www.xingshulin.com/">杏树林</a>, a content managegment system that
      serves Chinese physicians.

      I want my work to matter.

      During my time at WashU, I have a become proficient programmer, picking up various
      technologies along the way. I build things, and I do it well. I&#39;m very grateful
      for this experience, and I need to use it to better the lives of other people.

      At Washington University, I have learned from professors and peers alike.
      I value the stories of people around me just as much as I do the
      web frameworks and algorithms I learn.
      I want my work to matter to people. This mantra drives everything I do,
      from coding to performing slam poetry to simply listening to a new perspective.
