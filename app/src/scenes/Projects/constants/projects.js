    description: `I was tasked to create this calendar while learning about JavaScript in my Rapid Prototyping course.  The calendar uses AJAX to communicate with a PHP backend that handles all querying of events. Calendar features include adding and deleting events, user login, password encryption, filtering and/or escaping all content, CSRF tokens, and HTTP-only cookies.
    At this point in my career, this calendar was the largest and most complex application I had ever built. If I were to revisit it I would make some serious structural changes, but it served as my first real introduction to web development, and it served well.`,

    description: 'For my Rapid Prototyping final project, I made a joke website for my friend and then-TA, Chiraag. It was a simple image hosting, site akin to imgur, that also allowed post commenters to add images. This project was my first experience working with a modern web framework, Ruby on Rails. Going in I didnâ€™t know a lick of Ruby, but I had a lot of fun figuring everything out.',
